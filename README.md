Creating Metrics to Gauge genAI's Impact on Software Development

This project focuses on creating metrics and evaluation models to assess the impact of generative AI (genAI), particularly GitHub Copilot, on software development processes. The objective is to quantify and analyze how genAI tools improve efficiency, code quality, and overall productivity in software development workflows.
